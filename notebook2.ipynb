    "\n",
    "When using a data type it's helpful to understand what you can do to manipulate that data type. What methods are available to us. This is true for types such as [string](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp), [tuple](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp), [dict](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp), and [list](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp). We're going to focus on list this week. They are listed below. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Method\tDescription\n",
    "* append()\tAdds an element at the end of the list\n",
    "* clear()\tRemoves all the elements from the list\n",
    "* copy()\tReturns a copy of the list\n",
    "* count()\tReturns the number of elements with the specified value\n",
    "* extend()\tAdd the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list\n",
    "* index()\tReturns the index of the first element with the specified value\n",
    "* insert()\tAdds an element at the specified position\n",
    "* pop()\tRemoves the element at the specified position\n",
    "* remove()\tRemoves the first item with the specified value\n",
    "* reverse()\tReverses the order of the list\n",
    "* sort()\tSorts the list\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, what do you do when your program isn't working? There are many tools that can be used to debug. First be aware that when Python throws an error at you, it's going to give you some knowledge of where that error is coming from. It often will point to a line, and then indicate what type of error you are receiving. Jupyter notebook does have a more robust debugger tool, but it requires some additional installs. For the time being we're going to use some more manual techniques. Note that jupyter notebooks can enable or disable view on the line numbers. Under `view` there is an option which says `Toggle Line Numbers` which in my notebook has a hotkey of `shift-L`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dictionaries\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will implement a dictionary. A dictionary is a [hashable](https://medium.com/@faith.chikwekwe/how-dictionaries-work-in-python-162c6386c2cf#:~:text=The%20dictionary%20uses%20each%20key%27s,exactly%20which%20bucket%20to%20search.) data type, which has huge implications for computational efficiency. Let's remind ourselves how they work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every dictionary has a key and a value. The key is how we find the value. Dictionaries are demarcated with `{}`. So we might build a dictionary like the following. \n",
    "\n",
    "> `mydictionary = {'key': value}`\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also add to a dictionary simply by building a new key. This is done in the following way. \n",
    "\n",
    "> `mydictionary['newkey'] = value`\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing that's important and very valuable is that the value can be any data type. The key should be a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Class \n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed last week, the heart of object oriented programming (OOP) is the use of classes. They are activated with the keyword class. \n",
    "\n",
    "`class Example:\n",
    "    def __init__(self):\n",
    "        #functions that happen upon the initial call of the class\n",
    "        privariable = 0 #This is an example of a private variable\n",
    "        self.pubvariable = 0 #This is an example of a public variable. It can be accessed from outside. \n",
    "    def classfunction(self):\n",
    "        return #this is optional. You can also have a function modify a public variable from within the class.`\n",
    "        \n",
    "#### *HL* Abstract Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on our understanding of classes, we are going to create a class called Node. We are then going to build that in order to create a linked list, which is an example of an abstract data structure. Other common abstract data structures are stacks or queues. But we'll look at that in greater detail below. "
